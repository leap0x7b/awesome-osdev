Design of the UNIX Operating System]*
| |*Author(s):* Maurice Bach
| |*Publication date:* May 27th, 1986
| |*Description:* This book describes the internal algorithms and the
structures that form the basis of the UNIX® operating system and their
relationship to the programmer interface. The system description is
based on UNIX System V Release 2 supported by AT&T, with some features
from Release 3.

|*https://www.amazon.com/Operating-Systems-Principles-Thomas-Anderson/dp/0985673524[Operating
Systems: Principles and Practice]*
| |*Author(s):* Thomas Anderson and Michael Dahlin
| |*Publication date:* August 21st, 2014
| |*Description:* Over the past two decades, there has been a huge
amount of innovation in both the principles and practice of operating
systems Over the same period, the core ideas in a modern operating
system - protection, concurrency, virtualization, resource allocation,
and reliable storage - have become widely applied throughout computer
science. Whether you get a job at Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or any
other leading-edge technology company, it is impossible to build
resilient, secure, and flexible computer systems without the ability to
apply operating systems concepts in a variety of settings. This book
examines the both the principles and practice of modern operating
systems, taking important, high-level concepts all the way down to the
level of working code. Because operating systems concepts are among the
most difficult in computer science, this top to bottom approach is the
only way to really understand and master this important material.

|*https://www.amazon.com/Operating-Systems-Design-Implementation-Second/dp/0136386776[Operating
Systems: Design and Implementation]* 2nd Edition
| |*Author(s):* Andrew S. Tannenbaum and Albert S. Woodhull
| |*Publication date:* January 15th, 1997
| |*Description:* Most books on operating systems deal with theory while
ignoring practice. While the usual principles are covered in detail, the
book describes a small, but real UNIX-like operating system: MINIX. The
book demonstrates how it works while illustrating the principles behind
it. Operating Systems: Design and Implementation Second Edition provides
the MINIX source code. The relevant selections of the MINIX code are
described in detail. When it first came out, MINIX caused something of a
revolution. Within weeks, it had its own newsgroup on USENET, with
40,000 people. Most wanted to make MINIX bigger and fancier. Instead,
Linux was created. That has become quite popular, very large, and
complicated. MINIX, on the other hand, has remained small and suitable
for instruction and example. The book has been revised to include
updates in MINIX, which started out as a v7 unix clone for a floppy-disk
only 8088. It is now aimed at 386, 486, and pentium machines and is
based on the international posix standard instead of on v7. There are
now also versions of MINIX for the Macintosh and SPARC available.
Professional programmers will find this book to be a valuable resource
and reference.

Systems: Design and Implementation]* 3rd Edition
| |*Author(s):* Andrew S. Tannenbaum and Albert S. Woodhull
| |*Publication date:* January 4th, 2006
| |*Description:* Operating Systems Design and Implementation, 3e, is
ideal for introductory courses on computer operating systems. Written by
the creator of MINIX, professional programmers will now have the most
up-to-date tutorial and reference available today. Revised to address
the latest version of MINIX (MINIX 3), this streamlined, simplified new
edition remains the only operating systems text to first explain
relevant principles, then demonstrate their applications using a
Unix-like operating system as a detailed example. It has been especially
designed for high reliability, for use in embedded systems, and for ease
of teaching.
